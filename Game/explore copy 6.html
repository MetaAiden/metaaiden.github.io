		<h3>Boss - Lizard Lv10</h3>
		<p>
		The Lizard is destroying the city! No sparing, kill him! 
		</p>
		<p>
		You dove in and hit the Lizard's head with the baseball head. It seemed to do nothing. You decided to hit his private zone. He reacted and felt pain. You kept doing that until the Lizard died. You made a Lizard Scale Sword with the scales that the lizard had. Good job! You killed the lizard! You gained 100xp! You are Lv2! You can now move onto Chapter 3!
